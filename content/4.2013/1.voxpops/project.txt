Vox Pops is a journalistic investigation of this year’s cornerstone themes in the form of roughly twenty-minute podcasts available to stream each morning of the conference. Vox Pop(uli), Lt. ‘voice of the people’, is a reporting style that surveys the street spontaneously posing the same question to members of the general public. Here, the prompts are derived from stated conference concerns, such as ‘What constitutes a public?’ or ‘How is a public formed?’ To provocate these issues on the ground level, collaborating reporters target active participants of the event and casual observers alike.
