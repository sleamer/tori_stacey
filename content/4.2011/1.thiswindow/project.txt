These site-specific works are part of a series of transparent vinyl placed on various windows throughout the Portland area. The text on the top image reads “This window was handcrafted by Robert Morris in 1967.” The text on the bottom image reads “This window, when tapped on, produces sound.” Originally commissioned for Reed College and Portland State University campuses.
