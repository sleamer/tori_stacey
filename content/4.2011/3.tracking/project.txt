Tracking strategies starts with 25 5’x3’ black and white prints layered atop one another and cut into a grid of 2” squares. These squares take on a post-it note form, so that viewers are invited to remove individual squares, or ‘pixels’, from the larger image. When first installed, the image is a shadowy blur that only hints at the overall composition. As participants tear off the pixels, the image becomes sharper and more in focus, revealing the parts of the image that the collective viewership desires most to see over time, and eventually, the whole image. The process is recorded by a surveillance camera to show the progression, creating a physical reenactment of digital eye-tracking software that isolates key parts of images for marketing purposes. A publication discussing digital surveillance and the disappearance of individual subjectivity accompanies the installation.
