In Fall and Winter of 2013, Tori Abernathy has taken naps in semi-public, privatized spaces. Hotel lobbies, bank waiting areas, and benches near the elevator at the public library are spaces that require supervision to maintain order. In these quasi “third places”, dwellers can wait, but they’re unable to dream. Audio recorded during these sessions has been compiled into a single track overlaid with music by Jordan Dykstra. Together these sounds operate as a series of relaxation tracks to lull the listener into a splendid, dreamy state.
