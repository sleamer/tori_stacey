<em>300 Resumes, 8 1/2” x 11” and workshop led by Right to the City Organizers
RECESS, Portland, OR</em>

<br>
A curated selection of resumes and curriuculum vitae collected through an open call. “We’re all familiar with the challenge of making a resume. The competing goals surrounding resume building appear to be in fundamental conflict. On the one hand, job seekers are pressed to reduce their experiences into quantifiable, coherent chunks. They also hope to manifest their specific personhood on the page. In both content and form, the resume or curriculum vitae becomes a singular portrait of the job seeker’s professional self. As the national wage gap steadily climbs and the creative industry rises in favor of industrial capital, the value of everyday citizens becomes inscribed evermore by their labour. For Hire explores the methods adopted by job seekers to vocalize their professional merit.”
