Free School and Installation PNCA Swigert Commons, Portland OR</em>

<br>
Public Schools is an artist­run free school that invites existing alternative education platforms to activate PNCA’s Swigert Commons during the month of August. Public Schools highlights the variety of accessible modes of free education that already exist throughout the city. Abernathy and RECESS provided support in the form of a printed reader, an online and in­print calendar, and an extensive PR campaign. Over the course of the month, there was at least one event scheduled for any given day. We also curated an installation culled from the ephemera and activities of each group that evolved over the course of our stay in the Commons. In this way, the public was left with some of the same questions that had cropped up over the course of our research. They were invited to participate, but also to reflect.
