Peninsula Memories is an audio walking tour produced for Peninsula Park’s Centennial Celebration that highlights the individual narratives comprising the history of Peninsula Park Recreation Center and the surrounding area. The bulk of the content of the audio tour will be culled from interviews with local area residents, park affiliates, and active members of the park’s programs. In addition, voice-over narratives will discuss the broader cultural impact of these specific historical events and editorialize the personal stories. Field sounds mixed from local soundscapes will accompany the tracks, creating an atmospheric effect on the listener as they walk through present-day Peninsula Park.
